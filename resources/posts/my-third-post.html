  How people learn all of this CSS stuff is mind-blowing! I can learn it, but to remember it all, boy oh boy...
  I'm assuming it takes a ton of practice. That way, it becomes ingrained in your head and you don't forget things.
  Almost like muscle memory.

  Speaking of learning... I must say, React is so confusing to me.
  I applied for a Laravel job and I'm supposed to take a test on it, so that's why I'm trying to learn Laravel now!
